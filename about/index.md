Fatpixels is a blog about personal experiences with photography and programming, authored by
Alvina Joshi and Krishnashish Gogoi. While these two topics are the main focus of the blog, there
will occasionally (read as most-of-the-time) be posts pertaining to other things as well.

You may find informative posts, but take care that most of these posts are from the authors' personal
experiences, successes and failures. So, take them with a pinch of salt as some of the more informative
posts might not exactly apply to you in the same manner. Rest assured, the authors try their
best to make the posts interesting and useful. The authors hope that you have as much fun
reading this blog as they have writing it.

This blog is currently running on Github pages using Jekyll. The theme for the current look is
the [so-simple-theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/) by Michael Rose.

You can find Alvina's bucket of photos here (updated whenever she takes new pictures): [Photobucket](http://s1381.photobucket.com/user/Alvina_Joshi/library/).
