excerpt: "fat guy writes about things...once in a while."

Fat guy writes his fat opinions about topics that are usually far too fat for
him to reasonably comprehend.

Hello. My name is Krishnashish Gogoi. I write about stuff here. Stuff includes
programming, web development, game development and unnecessary opinions on
largely unnecessary topics. I work as a game developer by day, and metamorph
into a game developer by night. Every once in a while, I take vacations off into
the vast jungles of the Javascript ecosystem, where I masquerade as a web developer.
Thankfully, such vacations have been far and few lately. Yes, my life is mostly
miserable.

I don't write too often. Once every two years, I start getting dreams that I have
a blog. That's usually when I wake up and post something here.
