Hello, denizens of the Internet.

With humble yet delayed beginnings, we finally decided to write the first post
for this blog. Nothing special, just a little bit about what's about to come
and everything.

If you haven't checked the [About][http://fatpixels.me/about/] page yet, we'd
recommend you starting there. It has a short description about the blog, so
it'll give you the general idea.

Most of our posts will be from our personal experiences. Alvina is a budding
photographer and spends a lot of her time going to events and taking her shots,
and eating cakes, ice cream and [insert favorite non-orange dessert here].
Krishnashish is a learning programmer with frequent symptoms of hubris, and
often spends his time reading bad reviews about programming books he already
hates to reassure himself that they are still to be hated.

As both of us are light years away from expertise in our fields, our posts will
mostly contain bits of information from our own experiences, sweet successes and
bitter failures. If you feel that we're trodding the wrong path, don't shy away
from letting us know in the post by using the comment section.

The feature image for this post is by Alvina herself. She took this about a year
ago or so. It sort of has a 'new beginning' feeling to it, at least to me, which
is why I feel that it makes a good feature photo for the first post in
[fatpixels][http://fatpixels.me].

That's all for our first post. Keep checking back for more posts coming up!
